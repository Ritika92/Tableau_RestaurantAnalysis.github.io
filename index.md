## Solution suggested:
North Indian is the most common cuisine across the country which is decently priced. Noida is a metropolitan city close to National capital with very few restaurants serving North Indian cuisine and Noida has much lesser number of votes (meaning fewer people eating out) which means there is a solid potential market for “North Indian” cuisine in “Noida”. Also, Online delivery is an important service to provide as per the good ratings for restaurants providing online delivery.
Thus, the Restaurateur should open a “North Indian” cuisine restaurant in “Noida” and provide “Online delivery” service.
